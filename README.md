# MSIX Packaging SDK 
--------------------
    Copyright (c) 2017 Microsoft Corp.  All rights reserved.

# DESCRIPTION
-------------
   The MSIX Packaging SDK project is an effort to enable developers on a variety of platforms to package and unpackage 
   application packages for the purposes of distribution from either the Microsoft Store, or 2nd/3rd party stores.  
    
   The MSIX Packaging format is an evolution of the Windows 8 era AppX package format as detailed at: 
   https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsappdev/2012/12/04/designing-a-simple-and-secure-app-package-appx/. 
    
   The MSIX Packaging APIs that a client app would use to interact with .msix/.appx packages are a subset of those
   documented here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh446766(v=vs.85).aspx.  See 
   ./sample/ExtractContentsSample/ExtratContentsSample.cpp for additional details.


# OVERVIEW
----------
The MSIX Packaging SDK project includes cross platform API support for unpacking of .msix/.appx packages

    The MSIX Packaging SDK project includes:

        msix            - A shared library (DLL on Win32, dylib on MacOs, SO on Linux and Android) that exports a subset
                          of the functionality contained within appxpackaging.dll on Windows.  See:
                          https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh446766(v=vs.85).aspx
                          for additional details.

                          On all platforms instead of CoCreating IAppxFactory, a c-style export: CoCreateAppxFactory is 
                          provided.  See sample folder at root of package for cross platform consumption examples.

                          Finally, there is one export 'Unpack' that provides an simplified unpackage implementation.
                          
        makemsix        - A command line wrapper over the Unpack implementation.  This tool exists
                          primarily as a means of validating the implementation of the MSIX Packaging SDK internal
                          routines and is compiled for Win32, MacOS, and Linux platforms.

# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
    Step 1: Clone the repository:
        git clone [URL]
        
    Step 2: Initialize git submodules:
        git submodule init
        git submodule update

# ISSUES
--------
    If you are using Visual Studio 2017 and you run into errors about not being able to find the v140 toolset:
        step 1: Install the Microsoft Build Tools (https://chocolatey.org/packages/microsoft-build-tools)
        step 2: Start -> visual studio installer -> Visual Studio Build Tools 2017 -> 
                Modify the 2014 toolset -> individual components 
        step 3: Make sure that VC++ 2015.3 v140 toolset for desktop is selected and then unselect VC++ 2017 141 toolset
        step 4: Close, then re-open the solution.

# BUILD
-------
    On Windows using Visual Studio 2017 nmake:
    ------------------------------------------
        makewin32.cmd

    On Mac using make: 
    ------------------
        ./makemac
        ./makeios
    
    On Linux using make:

        ./makeaosp
    
    How to compile for Android on Windows:
    --------------------------------------
    Unpack the latest Android NDK to c:\android-ndk
    Unpack Ninja-build to c:\ninja
    Add c:\ninja to the path environment variable
    Create a folder under the root of the enlistment called "android", cd into that folder, 
    then run the following command to create ninja build files:

    cmake -DCMAKE_ANDROID_NDK=c:/android-ndk ^
        -DCMAKE_ANDROID_NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION=clang ^
        -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Android ^
        -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=19 ^
        -DCMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI=x86 ^
        -DCMAKE_ANDROID_STL_TYPE=c++_shared ^
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
        -DAOSP=on ^
        -G"Ninja" ..

    To compile, run the following command from the android folder:
